# worlds worst wordle
Fun little project built using ncurses and the worst collection of five letters words. There are only 650 or so words and includes many duplicates... who came up with this list?! I lazily pulled it from some random site.

Look, doesn't even have "smack" as a valid word. Unplayable. But that's okay cuz no one will play this or even read this.
